BlockProt is a lightweight Bukkit and Spigot plugin that gives players the ability to protect chests, furnaces and many more blocks.
The plugin features a modern GUI approach instead of commands, so that any player can easily understand how to use all of its features.

## Installing

To use this plugin, you can simply download it from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/blockprot)
or [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/blockprot.87829/) and place it in your `plugins` directory.
You do not have to install anything else and any recent version will work with 1.14, 1.15, 1.16 and 1.17. It runs
on any Spigot and any fork thereof and does **not** run on CraftBukkit.

To get the latest updates the quickest, you can "watch" or "star" this repository or frequently check the
[Release tab](https://github.com/spnda/BlockProt/releases). Alternatively, it is also possible to
[watch the resource](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/blockprot.87829/watch) on Spigot, which will also notify
you as soon as new builds get released.
