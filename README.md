# SPlugin

## ü§î **What is it?**

**_SPlugin_** is a lightweight spigot plugin designed for a basic server infrastructure. 
Admins can define groups of users, players can lock chests/hoppers... and everything is configurable to the server.

## üîß Configuration

To further configure discord and in-game settings you will need to add a `config.yml` 
file into `server/plugins/SPlugin`. That yml file can have various data:
- Discord:
    - Token: `String`. Your discord bot token. You can get one from your application https://discord.com/developers
    - JoinMessage: `bool`. If true, the bot will send a message for each player that join to discord.
    - LeaveMessage: `bool`. If true, the bot will send a message for each player that leaves to discord.
    - Channels: `List of Guild/Channel`. You can have one channel per guild but multiple guilds.
- Messages:
    - Join: `List of String`. A list of different messages to post when a player joins. `[player]` will be replaced with the player name.
    - Leave: `List of String`. A list of different messages to post when a player leaves. `[player]` will be replaced with the player name.
    - Death: `List of String`. A list of different messages to post when a player dies. `[message]` will be replaced with the original death message. `[player]` will be replaced with the player name.
    - SleepEnter: `List of String`. A list of different messages to post when a player enters a bed. `[player]` will be replaced with the player name.
    - SleepLeave: `List of String`. A list of different messages to post when a player leaves a bed. `[player]` will be replaced with the player name.
- Players:
    - player uuid:
        - Role: `OWNER` | `CITIZEN`
- Roles:
    - NEW_ROLE_ID:
        - Name: `String`. The displayed name of your new role.
        - Color: `Color`. The colour of your new role. Only 16 colours, no hex!
