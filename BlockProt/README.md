BlockProt is a lightweight Spigot/Paper plugin that gives players the abilit to protect chests, furnaces and many more blocks.

# 🔨️ Building yourself

SPlugin uses Gradle to handle dependencies as building.
Make sure you have Java 8 and Git installed, then run
```batch
git clone https://github.com/spnda/BlockProt.git
cd BlockProt/
gradlew build
```
All dependencies get shadowed automatically, meaning you won't need to install anything else on your server.
